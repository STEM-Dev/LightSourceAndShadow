The light particles that are not blocked by the screen help to expose a film-like surface, making it brighter. Rays can be drawn to show the exposure boundaries for each light source. A histogram reports the number particles that make it to the film locations as local intensity.\r\n\r\n## HOW TO USE IT\r\n\r\nSet the screen position (screen-x), the number of lights, and the ray-motion; press `setup` and then press `go`. For an exercise in the modeling class, we look at different `ray-motion` (straight, curve-left, and wiggle). The exercise is to gather evidence to support different models.\r\n\r\nThe `make-shadow-lines` function shows where the light is blocked by the screen and cannot expose the film.\r\n\r\n## THINGS TO NOTICE\r\n\r\nAs the light rays get the film on the right side, the discreet points become brighter. The histogram shows the brightness for each of these discreet points. Think of these as pixels on a screen. Sometimes these discreet points are on the shadow boundary. In this case, the intensity might not match one's expectation. This is like a numeric round-off error.\r\n\r\n## THINGS TO TRY\r\n\r\nTry running with different number of light sources and the screen at different locations. Can you predict how the film will be exposed?\r\n\r\nTry different `ray-motions`â€¦ How does the film expose? Does this match your expectations?\r\n\r\n## NETLOGO FEATURES\r\n\r\nA list is used for the light y-positions. The list is modified for an even number of lights.\r\n\r\nWhen the sources create the shadow boundaries, two shapeless turtles are created. The shape has no features. The two are then differentiated by their `who` number. We look for the max `who` for the upper boundary and then the min `who` for the lower. \r\n\r\n\r\n## CREDITS AND REFERENCES\r\n\r\nThis model was developed with the creative juices of Stan Yoshinobu, Matt Moelter, Chance Hoellwarth of the Center for Excellence in Science and Math at California Polytechnic University, San Luis Obispo, Ca\r\n\r\n## LICENSE\r\n\r\nLightSourceAndShadow Model.
